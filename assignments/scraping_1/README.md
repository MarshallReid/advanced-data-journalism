# Assignment 3: Dissecting a scraper

Your assignment here is pretty straightforward. Take the file in this folder, `jailscrape.py`, and use Python comments to explain line-by-line what you think it's doing.

Your final product will look something like this. For every line of code, add a comment describing what you think that line of code does:

```
# Import urllib2, which is a Python module that lets us download web pages
import urllib2

... etc.
```

When you're done, check it into you Github repo.

There will be things in here you probably don't know. That's ok! When you run into those, just Google for them and come up with the best explanation you can. Googling code snippets is a critical life skill, so this is a good excuse to get used to that.

This assignment shouldn't take you much time, so please turn it in by **Friday, March 23**.
