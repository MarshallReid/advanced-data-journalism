Codecademy exercise
===================

**Date**: Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2018

I won't be in class today, so this would be a good time to get started to start working on your [Codecademy assignments](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/tree/master/assignments/codecademy) and final projects.

Unless Mike has something else lined up, feel free to use the class time to get a head start on those things. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them Monday.
